        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Soup Joumou is traditionally consumed on New Yearâ€™s Day (January 1), as a historical tribute to Haitian independence day in 1804 where newly freed slaves consumed the soup, a meal forbidden to them by their French masters. Ingredients in the soup tend to vary and is usually driven by the cook.
